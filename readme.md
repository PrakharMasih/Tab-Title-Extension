## Tab Title Extension

The Tab Title Extension is a simple Chrome extension that enhances your browsing experience by providing a convenient way to retrieve and display the title of the current tab. Additionally, it offers a toggle switch for dark mode and a subtle animation to make the UI more engaging.

### Features

- **Tab Title Retrieval**: The extension allows you to quickly obtain the title of the currently active tab in your Chrome browser. This is particularly useful when you want to reference the title of a web page without having to navigate to it.

- **Dark Mode**: The extension includes a toggle switch that lets you switch between light and dark modes for a more comfortable viewing experience, especially in low-light environments. The dark mode changes the color scheme of the extension's popup, making it easier on the eyes.

- **Animations**: To enhance user interaction, the extension features animations. The sun and moon icons in the toggle switch exhibit rotating and tilting animations respectively, adding a touch of dynamism to the interface. Additionally, the tab title display fades in and slides up subtly when it's updated.
